                        <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869-1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who preached peace and non violence to fight against oppression. His ways, views and action made him to be known as Mahatma (great-souled). Now, he is known as Mahatma Gandhi throughout the world.Mahatma Gandhi led the national freedom struggle against the British rule. The most unique thing about this struggle was
                        that it was completely nonviolent.</p>
                        <p>Mohan Das Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2nd October, 1869 at Porbandar in Gujarat. After finishing his early education
                        in India, he sailed to England in 1891 and qualified as Barrister. In 1894, Gandhi went to South Africa in connection
                        with a law suit.</p>
                        <p>The political career of Gandhi started in South Africa where he launched a Civil Disobedience Movement against the
                        maltreatment meted out to Asian settlers. In 1916, he returned to India and took up the leadership of National Freedom
                        Struggle.</p>
                        <p>After the death of freedom fighter and congress leader Bal Gangadhar Tilak on August, 1920, Gandhi became virtually the
                        sole navigator of the ship of the congress. Gandhi had whole heartedly supported the British during the 1st World War
                        (1914-1919). The end of war, however, did not bring the promised freedom for India. So Gandhiji launched many movements
                        to force the British to concede India its Independence. The well known being: Non Co-operation Movement (1920), Civil
                        Disobedience Movement (1930) and Quit India Movement (1942).</p>
                        <p>The British passed the Rowlett Act in 1919 to deal with the revolutionaries. Gandhi made the Rowlett Act an issue and
                        appealed to the people to observe peaceful demonstration on April 6, 1919. Gandhi's call for peaceful demonstration met
                        with tremendous response. It led to mass demonstrations in Punjab and Delhi. The Jallianwala Massacre (1919) was a
                        sequel of this agitation. The Indian people were shocked by the way the British conducted themselves. Gandhi them
                        launched a non-co-operation in 1920 against the British rule. On 12th March 1930, Gandhi started his Civil Disobedience
                        with his famous 'Dandi March' to break the salt laws. Many leaders and persons courted arrest. Then followed the
                        Gandhi-Irwin Pact for the participation of the congress in the Second Round Table Conference in 1931. On March 1942, Sir
                        Stafford Cripps came to India with his proposals which were rejected by all political parties. The failure of the Cripps
                        Mission led to unprecedented disturbances. Disillusioned and disappointed, the congress passed at Bombay the Quit India
                        Resolution (August 8, 1942). The British were asked to leave India forthwith. The moving spirit behind the resolution
                        was Gandhiji. The Quit India Movement was the greatest challenge to the British empire.</p>
                        <p>Gandhi was a great leader, a saint and a great social reformer. He was pious, truthful and religious. He believed in
                        simple living and high thinking. Every body who came in contact with him were so deeply influenced by his personality.
                        He was a Champion of democracy and was deadly opposed to dictatorial rule. Gandhi showed India and the World the path of
                        truth and non-violence. He believed that it was truth alone that prevailed in the end. Gandhi believed that real India
                        lived in more than five lakhs villages uplift. According to him India's real emancipation depended on Swadeshi i.e.
                        boycott of foreign goods, use of khadi encouragement to village and cottage industries.</p>
                        <p>Gandhi began to work day and night for the freedom of his country. He and his brave followers went to jail again and
                        again, and suffered terrible hardships. Thousands of them were starved, beaten, ill treated and killed, but they
                        remained true to their master. At last his noble efforts bore fruit and on August 15,1947, India became free and
                        independent. Gandhi defeated the mighty British empire not with swords or guns , but by means of strange and utterly new
                        weapons of truth and Ahimsa. He worked all through his life for Hindu- Muslim Unity and the abolition of untouchability.
                        Gandhi worked hard for the upliftment of the Harijans, the name given by him to the untouchables. Gandhi declared
                        untouchability a sin against God and Man.</p>
                        <p>Gandhi wrote his famous autobiography under the title 'My Experiments with Truth'. Gandhi always stood for communal
                        harmony, but he himself was shot dead by a religious fanatic Nathuram Godse on 30th January, 1948. The whole World
                        mourned his death.
                        Concluding Remarks: Some one had quipped: "If they had not thrown Gandhi out of the train in South Africa, the English
                        would not have too much trouble from him." Gandhi, the young Attorney, vowed to oppose such unfair treatment- through
                        non-co-operation and other nonviolent means.</p>
                        <p>Gandhi's ultimate search was for righteous conduct. The means are more important than the end, he maintained; with the
                        right means, desired ends will follow. In time, he was proven right- almost always. His struggles and actions were but
                        external manifestations of his struggle to evolve his own value system. Mahatma Gandhi better known as the father of
                        Nation because it was he who got freedom for us. He was the maker of Modern India. <a rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi" target="_blank"><em>Know More</em>.....</a></p>
